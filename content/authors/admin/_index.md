Yanqun Xu is a reseracher in Zhejiang University and Harvard University. The research of Yanqun Xu focuses on the plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including applying VOCs in the decay prevention of foods by novel materials, analyzing the bio functions of VOCs in the plant-fungi interaction, the key VOC synthases genes evolution in strawberries. Molecular biochemical methods, bioinformatics and deep learning AI are used in her research.  In recent years, she has undertaken nine research projects, including two grants from the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation and one sub-project of the Chinese National "14th Five-Year" Key R&D Plan. In the past five years, She has published 63 papers, including 16 SCI papers in high-level food and postharvest journals such as New Phytologist (IF=10.32), Plant Cell & Environment (ESI Highly Cited Paper), and Food Chemistry, as the first or (co-)corresponding author. Among them, three papers have an IF>10, and 13 papers are in Q1 journals. She has been also been invited to publish two thematic reviews on plant VOCs and fresh food supply chains in the top food journal Trends in Food Science & Technology (2022, 125, 166-184 and 2023, 131, 61-76). She has been granted 27 patents (18 as one of the top three inventors, and seven international patents), eight of which have been industrialized, and she participated in the formulation of two industry standards for fruit and vegetable supply chains. The green postharvest preservation technology for fruits and vegetables based on VOCs innovation has shown significant economic benefits, winning the First Prize of Zhejiang Province Science and Technology Progress Award (4/13) and the Special Prize of Science and Technology from the China Federation of Commerce (1/12), and being shortlisted for the Top Ten Advances in China's Food Science and Technology in 2022. In recognition of outstanding academic achievements, She has been selected for the 8th China Association for Science and Technology's Young Talent Support Program and Zhejiang Province's "Top Young Innovators" program. She starts her bioinformatic projects on strawberries at Harvard University in 2023.
